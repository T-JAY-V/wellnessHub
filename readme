## Project Reflection
This project successfully merges multiple UI/UX features into a single lightweight HTML page without dependencies on build tools. It can be easily extended into a full-stack web application by integrating a backend and database. The main challenge was ensuring dark mode styles applied uniformly across all UI components and maintaining accessibility in modals and sliders. Future improvements could include form validation, animations on scroll, and API integration for live data.
